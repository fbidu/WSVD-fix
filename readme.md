# WSVD Fix

This is the assignment I did for the course  [Techniques and Tools to Prevent and Detect Software Security Vulnerabilities](https://eden.dei.uc.pt/~mvieira/unicamp.html) by professor [Marco Vieira](https://eden.dei.uc.pt/~mvieira/)


The full assignment consisted of detecting potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities using [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/), fixing three, designing a test to explore other three and fixing all the vulnerabilities in Database.java file.
